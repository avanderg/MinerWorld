This project was to refactor code to make it object-oriented. The given_code directory contains the original code
given, and the final directory contains the refactored code. The initial program is a simple "game" where miners
hunt for ore and mine it then bring it to a blacksmith. After a period of time, iron turns to iron ore and iron ore
turns into ore blobs. When iron changes to iron ore it makes a quake and ore blobs move toward quakes. The refactored
version includes this same functionality but also adds functionality defined in WORLD_EVENT.txt.
The program can be open and run in Intellij or with the supplied Makefile.

Both projects can be built with:
    $ make
The refactored project can be built with:
    $ make build
The given code can be built with:
    $ make build_old
The refactored code can be run with:
    $ make run
And the given code can be run with:
    $ make run_old
